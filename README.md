# Luckee
A simple ETH game (developing). It is a smart contract written by Solidity.

Users can create new games or join exist games. When the games have enough participants, it will start to run and will select one loser who will automatically create a new game with his/her ETH balance.

So this is a game about one loser and the other winners.
